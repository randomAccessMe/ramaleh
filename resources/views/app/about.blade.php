            <p>
                Take a look behind the scenes, and see how this project was built.
                You can also view other contributions of mine <a href="https://github.com/randomAccessMe">here</a>,
                although most of my contributions are to private repos.

            <h2>VISIT THE ADMIN AREA</h2>
            <p>
                To compensate for the lack of websites I can share on here,
                I decided to show off a little bit of my skills in the admin area for this website.

                In case you were an employer and you like what you see,
                feel free to download a PDF version of my updated resume
                and <a href="#contact">contact me</a> for any questions.
