# SB Admin 2 Laravel Template

[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/laravel/framework/license.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/framework)

This is a simple template intigrating the awesome SB Admin 2 template into Laravel 5.2. It minimizes requests to JS and CSS files using Elixir along with SASS. It allows you to start building laravel apps with a ready Admin area.

## Installation

As Simple as:  
1. `git clone git@github.com:randomAccessMe/sb-admin-2-laravel-template.git`  
2. `composer install`  
3. `npm install`  

To start with a fresh copy of the template without any of the example pages run:  
`php artisan clean-template`  
This will save a backup of the old example views in "stubs/sb-admin-backups" for later reference.  
  
I use this for personal projects mainly and will try to keep it up to date with any new versions of Laravel or SB Admin, but feel free to contribute with any suggestions or pull requests.
